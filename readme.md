# About Chipped Beef

This framework is nowhere near done! I'm adding to it as I go, and is not anywhere near a usable state. Also, be aware that I built this for use in my own projects, so some things that I think are perfect for my workflow might be crazy to you.

## Latest Revisions

As of July 2nd, 2013
- Rewrote much of the grid module. Now both the fluid AND fixed grids support LESS! Yay! It's now much easier to changed fixed grid sizes and adapt the grid to fit in padded containers.
- Tidied up some things!

## Usage

There are two folders. One for the uncompiled LESS and another for final CSS. Edit the LESS files to customize the framework and change variables. While you can use the LESS files directly in the browser, best practices suggest that you first compile the LESS into vanilla CSS.

## Why the Bootstrap Grid?

Grids take a lot of work to build. There's no point in reinventing the wheel, so I decided to use the open source grid in Twitter's Bootstrap. The Bootstrap grid is fantastic. It includes both a static and fluid grid, and is responsive.
