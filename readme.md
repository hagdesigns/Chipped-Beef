# About Chipped Beef

This is a little project I began working on to build a design framework so I can rapidly prototype new websites. Not very many new ideas to be found here, and much is borrowed from Bootstrap, but it's setup exactly how I like it. Also, be aware that I built this for use in my own projects, so some things that I think are perfect for my workflow might be crazy to you.
