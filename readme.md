# About Chipped Beef

This is a little project I began working on to build a design framework so I can rapidly prototype new websites. Not very many new ideas to be found her, and much is borrowed from Bootstrap, but it's setup exactly how I like it. Also, be aware that I built this for use in my own projects, so some things that I think are perfect for my workflow might be crazy to you.

As of August 9th, 2013
- Still working to get the grid module the way I want it. Made some more changes in order to make it as flexible as possible. Inputs should now fit columns correctly.
- Added a forms module. Comes with some good default styling for inputs and textareas. Still not feature complete.
- Updated the normalize module to apply correct box-sizing to more HTML5 elements.
- More polish!

As of July 2nd, 2013
- Rewrote much of the grid module. Now both the fluid AND fixed grids support LESS! Yay! It's now much easier to changed fixed grid sizes and adapt the grid to fit in padded containers.
- Tidied up some things!

## Usage

There are two folders. One for the uncompiled LESS and another for final CSS. Edit the LESS files to customize the framework and change variables. While you can use the LESS files directly in the browser, best practices suggest that you first compile the LESS into vanilla CSS.

## Why the Bootstrap Grid?

Grids take a lot of work to build. There's no point in reinventing the wheel, so I decided to use the open source grid in Twitter's Bootstrap. The Bootstrap grid is fantastic. It includes both a static and fluid grid, and is responsive.
